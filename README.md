## Overview

Tis the holiday season again, where we relax at home, eat loads of good food and spin driedels. This year, **let's keep learning** all the great stuff learned during the [vBrownBag DevOps sessions](http://professionalvmware.com/vbrownbag-devops-series/).

Recordings, as always, are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaZf13iWhwnBdpIkrEmHLbA) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/professionalvmware-vbrownbag/id468638808?mt=2)


## The Challenge

Push yourself to use GitHub everyday throughout the holiday season so that by 2015 you're ready to share your next project. Here's how:

1. Schedule time in your calendar for gitting in shape **every day** for the 12 days between December 21st - January 1st
2. Choose your skill level: [Beginner](#beginner), [Intermediate](#intermediate), [Advanced](#advanced), or [Expert](#expert)
3. Follow the directions under your skill level!
4. Fork this repository to show that you're participating!

That's it! If you get stuck or just want to chat with others, be sure to tweet with the hashtag `#vBrownBag` or [visit our G+ community page.](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/104346122697555179657) We'll be out there to help.

If you want more dynamic interaction, join our Slack team! You can get help or collaborate with others. To get access:

1. Tweet @joshcoen or @mjbrender your email address and we'll invite you
2. Once you get the invite, go to http://geekspeak.slack.com and sign in
3. Log in with your email address
4. Start collaborating!


## Commit to Your Skill Level
We all have different level of expertise when it comes to GitHub.


## Beginner
<a name="beginner"></a>
*You're a beginner if:* You're new enough to git that just the act of using it daily will be a lot of learning.

**Setup**:
* Create a GitHub account
* [Setup Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* Initialize your own new repository with a README
* Clone your repository to your local development system

**Your challenge**:
* Update the README.md file **every day** with something you learned that day
* Add a meaningful comment to your commit. [Learn the right way to comment your commits.](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/wiki/Git-Commit-Message-Format)
* Push that commit to your GitHub repository
* Create additional repositories for scripts that you've created to do your job
* Learn how to use [`git commit --amend`](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/26/using-git-amend-for-quick-corrections).
* [Keep your fork in sync with the original repo](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/27/updating-your-git-fork-from-the-original-repo/).

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember that the goal of this is to *learn how to use GitHub*, so focus on git, not other code you'd also like to learn
* Feel free to use the GitHub website, native apps or command line. [Watch this vBB](http://neckbeardinfluence.com/technical-quick-hacking-your-way-into-github/) on GitHub to help you along
* Markdown is awesomely powerful, so challenge yourself to use some of the more complex syntax. [You can learn it all here.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)


## Intermediate
<a name="intermediate"></a>
*You're at an intermediate level if:* You're comfortable with the basics of using git, have lurked around on GitHub but never contributed to a project.

**Setup**:
* Fork an interesting repository that you want to contribute to
* Clone your repository to your local development system
* Create a new branch to develop in

**Your challenge**:
* Update the repository's Master branch **every day** in some way
* On your new branch, work on a meaningful contribution to your fork of the repository
* Add meaningful comments to your commits when you commit on both branches
* Open a Pull Request on the original repository from your new branch by the end of the 12 days of Commitmas!
* Learn how to use [`git rebase`](http://rnelson0.com/2014/12/23/using-git-rebase-to-rewrite-history/).

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember, *documentation is code too (especially when using Markdown)!* Find a project you want to support by improving documentation. Fork it and then make your contributions during this challenge.

## Expert
<a name="expert"></a>
*You're an expert if:* You've managed multiple contributor repositories before, have more than 5 pull request accepted, and want to join in Commitmas to really push yourself.

**Setup**:
* You've done this a few times.

**Your challenge**:
* Open a new Pull Request on open source repositories you use **every single day** for the 12 days of Commitmas!
* Write a blog post describing a task/skill that you feel is important for Beginner or Intermediate level users to raise their git-fu!

**Helpful hints**:
* You really don't need any, but if you complete this challenge, please tell me ([@mjbrender](http://twitter.com/mjbrender)) and I'll definitely buy you a beer.
